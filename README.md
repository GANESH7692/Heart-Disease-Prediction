# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The aim of this project is to predict whether the patient is suffering from a heart disease or not.
I’m using Logistic Regression Algorithm for this Project because it is easier to implement, interpret, and very efficient to train.
I’m using Heart.csv file which consists of 304 Patients data.(from kaggle.com)
